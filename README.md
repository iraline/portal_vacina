This repository was developed with the aim of improving knowledge of some ruby on rails concepts that are part of the development of an API

## How it works


The user's permission will limit what can and cannot be accessed by the user. For now, there are 3 types of user:

Common - Can only see all data from _Dose_ table

Health area - Can create data in _Dose_ table and see the others tables

Government - Can CRUD data in all tables
